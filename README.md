# Prison Break Project: Analyzing Helicopter Escapes
On multiple occassions, prisoners have tried to break out of prison with the aid of helicopters. The aim of this project was to answer the following questions:

- In which year did the most attempts at breaking out of prison with a helicopter occur?
- In which countries did the most attempted helicopter prison escapes occur?

To answer these questions, I scraped and analyzed data from [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) Wikipedia page. It covers the details of attempted helicopter prison escapes over a 50-year period (1971-2020). I used Python programming and Jupyter notebook for this project.


## Preparing the Data
Step 1: I imported the modules and libraries I would need.
Step 2: I loaded the data into the notebook using Pandas. 
Step 3: I explored the dataset. The data contained six fields:
1. The date of the attempted prison break
2. The name of the prison
3. The country where it happened
4. Whether the attempt was successful or not
5. The names of the escapees
6. More details about the case
