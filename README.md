# Prison Break Project: Analyzing Helicopter Escapes
On multiple occassions, prisoners have tried to break out of prison with the aid of helicopters. The aim of this project is to answer the following questions:

- In which year did the most attempts at breaking out of prison with a helicopter occur?
- In which countries did the most attempted helicopter prison escapes occur?

To answer these questions, I analyzed data scraped from [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) Wikipedia page. It covers the details of attempted helicopter prison escapes over a 50-year period (1971-2020)
